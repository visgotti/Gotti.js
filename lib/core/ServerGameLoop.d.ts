/**
 * Create a game loop that will attempt to update at some target `tickLengthMs`.
 *
 * `tickLengthMs` defaults to 30fps (~33.33ms).
 *
 * Internally, the `gameLoop` function created has two mechanisms to update itself.
 * One for coarse-grained updates (with `setTimeout`) and one for fine-grained
 * updates (with `setImmediate`).
 *
 * On each tick, we set a target time for the next tick. We attempt to use the coarse-
 * grained "long wait" to get most of the way to our target tick time, then use the
 * fine-grained wait to wait the remaining time.
